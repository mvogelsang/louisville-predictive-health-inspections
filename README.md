# louisville-predictive-health-inspections

This project was inspired by [work done by the City of Chicago](https://github.com/Chicago/food-inspections-evaluation).

The code in this repo has a somewhat similar architecture, but functions totally differently and is written (in our humble opinion) a little more understandably and is likely easier to extend for the use of other cities.

A link to the (unlisted) youtube video that explains the Scheduler, Social Media Tool, and Website code along with a demonstration can be found [here](https://youtu.be/55_gJw3x6zA)

In sum, this project's predictive analytics, on average, schedule failed inspections 17 days sooner over a given 2-month period.
